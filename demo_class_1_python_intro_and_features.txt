What is Python?

Application

Fronetend Language:- HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,Jquery,JS
Backend Language  :- Functionality/Logic(Fronetend), Connect with database and send the information to fronetend:- Python
Database Language :- SQL,MySql,PgSql,Sqlite3, MongoDB (Data strore)


Python is Backend Laguage.


Why Python?

1. Application Backend Development
2. Datascience and Data analysis application
3. AI
4. Machine Learning and deep learing.
5. Automation Testing



Language Fundamentals:- 
----------------------

Introdction :-

1. Python is general purpose of high level programming laguage.
    

    > There are 3 types of programming laguage are avilable in IT.


          > Low Level Programming
          > Middum Level Programming
          > Hight Level Programming

 2.Python was developed by Guido Van Rossam in 1989, while working at National Research Insititute at Netherlands.

		> Python is mix of two language(Perl,C++)

3. 1991 Feb 20th python was officially lunched.


4. Python is scripting laguage, It's very easy to undestand for anyone.


Comparision:-
-------------

print:- Hello AT-4

java:-

public class Hello
{
	p s v main([String []  args])

	{
		SOP("Hello AT-4")

	}
}


C:-
---

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
	print("Hello AT-4")
}


Python:-
-------

print("Hello AT-4")


Where we can use python:-
------------------------

1. For Developing Desktop appllication
2. For Developing Web application
3. Fro Developing Database application
4. For Network Programming.
5. For developing games
6. For Data Anaysis application
7. For machine and deep learning
8. For Developing AT application
9. For IOT(Internet of things)



Limitation Python:-
-------------------

1. mobile application develeopment or mobile software.
2. Banking application.




Features Of Python:-
------------------

1. Simple and Easy to Learn:- 

2. Freeware and Opensource:-

3. High Level Programming Laguage:-

4. Platform Independent:- PVM(Python Virtual Machine)

5. Portability:-

6. Dynamically Typed:-


	variable = data(data type)-- statically
	var = data --- automatically detect the type of data.

	ex:- >>> a = 10
	>>> type(a)
	<class 'int'>


	Name(v) = 'Chandra Sekhar'(data)
	Age(v) = 25(data)


7.Both Procedure Oriented and Object Oriented.

8.Interpreted:-

9.Extensive Library:-


Python Version:-

Python 1.0V introduced in Jan 1994
Python 2.0V introduced in Oct 2000
Python 3.0V introduced in Dec 2008
